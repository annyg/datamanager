survey data. It provides a suite of functions to handle common tasks in
data preparation and scoring, including support for instruments such as
RAND-12 and EMQ.

## Features

-   **Data Management**: Effortlessly clean and organize questionnaire
    data.
-   **Scoring Functions**: Compute scores for recognized instruments
    including RAND-12 and EMQ.
-   **Efficient Workflow**: Streamline your data processing tasks in
    research settings.

```{r}
# Example for scoring RAND-12
# rand12_scores <- score_rand12(cleaned_data)
```

#### EMQ Scoring

```{r}
# Example for scoring EMQ
